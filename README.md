# JUNIQ-EPIQ-Summer-School-on-Quantum-Computing-
Participated in the summer school on quantum computing at the JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre (JSC), conducting a group project using neutral atoms on a Pasqal Simulator: Neutral Atoms - Solution of the Maximal independent set problem on a neutral atoms-based quantum computer.

Together with my group, I worked on solving the Maximal Independent Set problem using the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm on neutral atom quantum devices. We first studied the principles of this technology and then applied them to address a problem related to ecological conservation in a national park.
